# Principle 1
Every modification to the framework code must be recorded in the changelog to facilitate future framework version releases.

I will give you instructions when it's time to upgrade versions. You will determine whether a version upgrade is needed based on the changelog. If an upgrade is needed, update the version number and then update the changelog.

# Principle 2

When creating example projects, such as those in website or examples, if you determine that we need to modify the framework code to support them, please let me know. I will evaluate whether to make those changes.

# Principle 3

when upgrading the framework, you should check the changelog really update, and the version number really upgrade, and the installer's code really update.
